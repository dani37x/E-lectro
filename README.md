## E-lectro
<a name="readme-top"></a>

E-lectro is a web application built using the Flask framework, with the main purpose of serving as an online shop. However, unlike traditional e-commerce websites, E-lectro focuses on non-visual aspects, such as security and unique solutions for specific problems.

One such solution is the Random Forest Classifier, which is used to classify users and recommend suitable products for them. This algorithm takes into account various factors such as past purchases, search history, and other user data to make personalized product recommendations.

Another feature of E-lectro is the use of Redis queue, which is used as an asynchronous task queue. This allows for faster processing of user requests and helps to improve the overall performance of the application.
The project is a full backend solution, with a strong emphasis on security. It includes ready-made solutions like entries limiter and SQLAlchemy ORM, but also incorporates custom functions to solve specific problems.

Overall, E-lectro is a well-designed and fully-functional web application that demonstrates the power and flexibility of the Flask framework. Its unique features and emphasis on security make it a standout project in the world of e-commerce.
