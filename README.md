## About The Project
<a name="readme-top"></a>

E-lectro is a web application in Flask. Its destination is an online shop but centers on non-visual things. This project focuses on security and curious solutions for specific problems such as Random Forest Classifier, which classifies users and adequate products for them, or Redis queue, which his aim is async task queue. Full backend project, and what is more, everything terrific works deeply. The project contains ready solutions like entries Limiter or SQLAlchemy ORM, but there occur own functions with prevalence.
